# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room would like to develop a web-based game named Draw It or Lose It that can serve multiple platforms. This game is only availabe in an Andriod app. The client will need the game to support multiple teams with multiple players in each team to guess randomly selected images with the certain rules of time limits.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I wrote a software design paper that includes design constraints, system architecture overview, domain model, evaluation on development requirements of various OS and the recommendations on the operation platform, OS achitectures, storage and memory management, etc.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Provided with the UML Diagram, I was able to get a general picture of the architecture of the app to be developed and understand the relationship between each class. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the Recommendations. My recommendation is somewhat biased as I am a big fan of Windows OS, especially when it comes to playing games from the user's point of view. Since this game is web-based and is intended for multi-platforms, I should research more on other operating platforms, such as MacOS and Linux. I would research on the advantages and weakness of using either OS to develop the game as well as user experience with those operating platforms.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User's needs are the core of the software design. To maximize the customer satisfaction, the development team needs to work with the customer to ensure the deliverables fills in user requirements. Those user requirements should be translated as each function that the software will be able to provide during the designing process. And if the final product is mismatched with user's requirements, there is a waste of time and money for the whole development team. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I will follow the adaptive agile software development for future software designing. Implement the iteration of each sprint and conduct sprint review and retrospective. From working with product owner to get clear user stories to engaging customers in the process of the development for responsive feedback, from the software designing using UML model to the implentation of each function specified by the customers, and lastly work collaborately with coworkers.
